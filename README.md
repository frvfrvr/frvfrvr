### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Name's FRVFRVR! the last four letters are pronounced "forever"

*also my name is Francis*

Forking some stuff to work on motion tracking play-to-earn app in the future inspired by Just Dance and Wii Fit.ðŸŒ±

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve learned C and broaden my knowledge in programming thanks to [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x) (taking it on-off since 2013, and finally finished in year 2023 to check off my bucket list)

  *I also...*
- tinkered apps in Python and its built-in SQLite [thanks](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-python/) [to](https://www.techonthenet.com/sqlite/) [several](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) [Python](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/) [tutorials](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) [over](https://youtu.be/r-uOLxNrNk8) [years](https://youtu.be/byHcYRpMgI4) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) [learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw). (each word is a link to where I learned tips and tricks in Python and SQLite from and recommended it for anyone reading this profile)
- barely scratched the surface of PHP programming, [Javascript](https://javascript30.com/), [Jekyll](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm_Qt4aKpfKijgP0rDH7FSJOlS9IBGbT1). I overcame other problems by getting familiar with functions through similar uses in other places.
- Learned the fundamental skills in data science thanks to [Project SPARTA](https://coursebank.ph/sparta/) (a program only available in the Philippines) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). I also read [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/), [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), [Kaggle Blogs from Competition Winners](https://medium.com/kaggle-blog), [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) to digest my knowledge for more efficient approach.
- ...am practicing clean code in Python: following the write-ups written [here](https://dev.to/alexomeyer/10-must-know-patterns-for-writing-clean-code-with-python-56bf) and [here](https://jerrynsh.com/how-to-write-clean-code-in-python/). Clean code shows that since the last reader of your own code is yourself, so it's better to tidy it to look readable not only to your future co-workers but to you.
- I plan to learn: Ruby with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails), Godot with [GDQuest](https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/) and [Nim language](https://nim-lang.org/).
