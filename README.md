### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Name's FRVFRVR! the last four letters are pronounced "forever"

*also my name is Francis*

Forking some stuff to work on motion tracking play-to-earn app in the future inspired by Just Dance and Wii Fit.ðŸŒ±

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve learned C and broaden my knowledge in programming thanks to [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x) (taking it since 2013, and finally allocated time to finish this in 2021 to check off my bucket list)

  *I also...*
- tinkered apps in Python thanks to [several](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) [Python](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/) [tutorials](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) [over](https://youtu.be/r-uOLxNrNk8) [years](https://youtu.be/byHcYRpMgI4) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) [learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw). (each word is a link to where I learned tips and tricks in Python from and recommended it for anyone reading this profile)
- barely scratched the surface of PHP programming, [Javascript](https://javascript30.com/), [Jekyll](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm_Qt4aKpfKijgP0rDH7FSJOlS9IBGbT1). I overcame other problems by getting familiar with functions through similar uses in other places.
- Learned the fundamental skills in data science thanks to [Project SPARTA](https://coursebank.ph/sparta/) (a program only available in the Philippines) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- I plan to learn: Ruby with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails), Godot with [GDQuest](https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/)

- ðŸ‘¯ My work experience
- 	- I don't think my Flash game obituaries in Newsgrounds are considered as experience but tried nonetheless.
	- Dishwasher 
	- Supermarket Clerk (irasshaimase)
	- Burger flipper (irasshaimase)
	- Freelance video editor (Tip: don't accept lopsided jobs - especially bunch of JOs for only hundred bucks is no-no)
	- Never had a real coding job yet.

Developing my Telegram bot was my most successful work in coding so far.
